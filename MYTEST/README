I fixed the thinker.msh to include textcoords (so the texture should work now).

For our image we should just render the thinker in the middle of a museum-looking room (wood floor, white walls) with one famous painting hanging on each wall.  Daisy emailed me a cube mesh file with a corresponding texture that I'll photoshop famous paintings onto and put in the MYTEST folder.
